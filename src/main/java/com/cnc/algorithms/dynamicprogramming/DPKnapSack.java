/*
 * Dynamic programming example for solving the knapsack problem.
 *
 * The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization:
 * Given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the number of each item
 * to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given
 * limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem
 * faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with
 * the most valuable items.
