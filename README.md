## Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is intended to show various implementations of common data structure and algorithm problems. It is an on
going project as I come across interesting programming challenges. The solutions in here are not the most optimal but
have had some thought put into them.

## Quick Start

    * git clone
    * gradle clean build idea
    
## Practice

This branch is intended as a template to branch from and do your own work. The tests remain intact, but the data structure and algorithm implementations have been replaced with void or error code type return values.

   * git checkout Skeleton
